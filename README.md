- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FluveV
- ðŸ‘€ I have a Bachelor's degree in Sociology from Trento, Italy.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently in the making of my Master's degree in Data Science in Trento, Italy. I am making more use of this platform for storing my code with my colleagues and coworkers, but also to share what I've done in my degree for reference.
- ðŸ¥… Goals: robust statistical analysis, interpretable and reproducible results. Also, I am trying to work on the efficiency of my code, when I have time. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: you can use my email davide.vandelli@studenti.unitn.it. I do possess social media, but those are for a different time.
