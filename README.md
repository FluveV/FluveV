- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FluveV
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning. That's not it: also educated in Sociology and how society interacts with the most advanced technological systems. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently in the second year of Data Science Master's Degree in Trento
- ðŸŒ± I am making more use of this platform for storing my code but also to share what I've done in my degree
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: you can use my email davide.vandelli@studenti.unitn.it . I do possess social media, but those are for a different time.
