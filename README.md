- 👋 Hi, I’m @FluveV
- 👀 I’m interested in learning. That's not it: also educated in Sociology and how society interacts with the most advanced technological systems. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more Big Data technologies, but also modern machine learning and statistical methods. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on systems for risk prediction and monitoring. 
- 📫 How to reach me: you can use my email davide.vandelli@studenti.unitn.it . I do possess social media, but those are for a different time.
